*Instructions:* When making a request, replace the text < between chevrons > after first reading the instructions.  The instructions can be removed. Do not change any other text, and please try to complete as much information as you can (your request will get acted on sooner if you do).



**Operation name:**  < operation_name >

*Instructions:*  Name of operation, *e.g.* "Sequence aignment".  This is the most commonly used term.  



**Short description:** < short_description >

*Instructions:* Short description, *e.g.* "Align (identify equivalent sites within) molecular sequences." A sentence or two describing the operation, specifically stating *what* is done but not *how*. Keep it concise, lucid and avoid jargon and acronyms. See http://edamontology.org/operation_0004 for examples.



**Parent URI(s):** < EDAM Operation URI1 | EDAM Operation URI2 |... >

*Instructions:* URI(s) of suggested EDAM Operation parent(s) delimited by pipe ('|') *e.g.* "http://edamontology.org/operation_2928".  Pick the single, most relevant operation. In some (exceptional) cases, a broad operation type (top-level operation) *e.g.* "Comparison", "Calculation" *etc.* (see http://edamontology.org/operation_0004) may also be specified.


**Has Topic:** < Topic >

*Instructions:* A category denoting a rather broad domain or field of interest, of study, application, work, data or technology *e.g.* "Phylogenetic treehas topicPhylogenetics ". Topics have no clearly defined borders between each other.



**Has Input:** < EDAM Input >

*Instructions:* Operation has input Data *e.g.* "Sequence annotationhas inputSequence record". 



**Has Output:** < EDAM Output >

*Instructions:* Operation has output Data, *e.g.* "RNA structure predictionhas outputRNA structure record". 



**exactSynonym(s):** < synonym1 | synonym2 |... >

*Instructions:* Exact synonym(s) delimited by pipe ('|') *e.g.* "Sequence alignment generation". Other commonly-used terms, acronyms *etc.* by which the concept is referred to.  




**Wikipedia:** < URL1 | URL2 |... >

*Instructions:* URL(s) to Wikipedia pages delimited by pipe ('|') *e.g.* "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment". Provide link(s) to relevant Wikipedia pages, if any.



**Comment:** < comment >

*Instructions:* Comment to the EDAM developers. Add any comments you like for the EDAM developers to consider.
