- Many minor changes (new synonyms, minor structural changes etc.)

  **Bug fixes**
- Fixed synonyms that had URIs as values (1)

(1) for any synonyms that had a URI as value, that URI is now given as a seeAlso annotation instead. It was also necessary to remove all <owl:annotatedProperty> statements that defined a synyonm, from all "annotations on annotations", i.e. where comments had been added to an annotation on a class, via an owl:Axiom statement.


# EDAM\_1.6.owl

- A major revision of the EDAM Operation branch to simplify it and improve usability.
- 64 EDAM Operation concept deprecations.
- Top-level Operations now correspond to tool types in the ELIXIR Tools & Data Services Registry: Analysis, Query and retrieval, Visualisation, Deposition, Utility operation.
- Removal of excessively fine-grained Operation concepts.
- Removed "bioinformatics" subset and all corresponding annotations
- Removal of unnecessary "organisational" classes.
- Renaming of concepts (terms) to reflect the common terms in use.


# EDAM\_1.5.owl

# EDAM\_1.4.owl

- A major revision of the "Topic" sub-ontology expanding this into medical concepts (~60 new topics), following an effort led by Cath Brooksbank with major input from partners from EMTRAIN (European Medicines research TRAINing network) and partners from related ESFRI (European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures) projects.
- Fixing many minor bugs (mostly overlapping or bad synonyms) within topics, and other clean-ups.
- Removed the lowest tier of the "Topic" branch (mostly by moving terms up a level).
- Removed all `oboOther:namespace` and some subsets; removed most `oboInOwl:inSubset` for deprecated concepts and added subset 'obsolete'.
- New forms of UniProt identifiers added (regex).
- Examples of IANA and chemical media types added.
- A couple of file-/data-handling concepts added (operations and an identifier).
- An OBO-format version of EDAM has been omitted. We will only resume providing OBO format in case of substantial demand or full automation of the conversion.

  **And most importantly:**
- EDAM is now being developed at GitHub!!!



# EDAM\_1.3.owl

Highlights of changes:
- Greatly simplified "Topic" branch.
- Many new terms added for annotating tools in the [BioToolsRegistry](bioregistry.cbs.dtu.dk).



# EDAM\_1.2.owl

This is the first version of EDAM now that is maintained in OWL format. The OBO-format version is generated from it by processing the OWL file.

Highlights of changes:
- New references to MeSH.
- Edits to synonyms.
- About a dozen new formats.

- Clean-ups for cleaner viewing in Protege and OLS:
- Removed problematic "has input" and "has output" axioms.
- Cleaner annotations on the ontology itself.




# EDAM\_1.1.obo

Many additions (mostly in "Operation" and some in "Topic" branches) for "next generation" sequencing analysis.
EDAM now provides complete coverage of biological domains and bioinformatics methods from [SeqWiki](http://seqanswers.com/wiki/SEQanswers).
SeqWiki "biological domains" map to EDAM "Topic", SeqWiki "bioinformatics methods" map to EDAM "Operation".


# EDAM\_1.0.obo
The first release proper.

General changes
  - New style for concept IDs: 4 digit number, subontology namespace / subset("operation", "topic" etc) _e.g._
   "EDAM\_operation:0004" (new style) instead of "EDAM:0000004" (old style).

  - New relations ("has function", "is function of") are defined for use by annotators (they are not used in EDAM itself).

  - Synonyms are defined that define related or relevant concepts in many other ontologies and systems. Synonyms are added throughout but especially on top-level concepts ("Operation", "Data", "Format" and "Topic") and relations ("has input", "is input of", "has output", "is output of", "has topic", "is topic of", "has format", "is format of", "has function", "is function of").

  - New concept attributes and modifiers have been added, most importantly:

   "{note}" for comments on synonyms and other attributes, _e.g._
`synonym: "assembly" NARROW [SO:0001248] {note="Perhaps surprisingly, the definition of 'SO:assembly' is narrower than the 'SO:sequence\_assembly'."}`.

   "{since}" for annotation of version information, _e.g._ data of creation or obsoletion of a concept id:
`id: EDAM\_data:3165 {since=1.0}` or
`is\_obsolete: true {since=1.0}`.

"Format" branch
  - 10 new formats.




# EDAM\_beta13.obo
General changes
  - "Identifier" branch moved from top-level to beneath "Data". The "identifier" namespace / definitions have been kept!
  - Extensive revision of "Data", "Operation" and "Topic" branches to reduce clutter and ease navigation.
  - Bottom-up clean up removing terms that are too fine-grained. Top-down clean up to add or remove terms to aid navigation.
  - has\_topic (defined on "Data" and "Operation") replaces in\_topic.
  - Duplicated relationships (child terms erroneously restating the inherited relationships of their parents) have been removed.

"Data" branch
  - All "Data" concepts now organised into 4 sub-concepts:
   - "Core data" - Data that typically are the primary input or output of a tool or which correspond to entries from the primary (_e.g._ sequence or structural) biological databases.
   - "Identifier" - A short numerical or textual label that identifies (typically uniquely) something such as data, a resource or a biological entity.
   - "Parameter" - Typically a simple numerical or string value that controls the operation of a tool.
   - "Report" - A human-readable collection of information that is distinct from primary (_e.g._ sequence or structural) biological data, including free text, annotation about biological entities and phenomena, computer-generated reports of analysis of primary data and metadata.
   - "Report" concepts for sequences correspond better (without duplicating) established sequence feature keys.

"Operation" branch
   - Fewer concepts, simpler is\_a hierarchy
   - "has\_input" and "has\_input" relations defined (on nearly all terms)

"Format" branch
   - "is\_format\_of" relations defined (for nearly all terms)

"Topic" branch
   - Improved term names and is_a hierarchy, reflecting whether topics concern a type of data, operation or are more general.
   - New "Biological data resources" sub-branch includes common data resource concepts.
   - Major revision! Too much to mention, so take a look :)





# EDAM\_beta12.obo
General changes
   - OBO subset definitions added
   - Sub-ontologies / namespaces / subsets now are "topic", "data", "format", "identifier", "operation"
   - Relation types now are "in\_topic", "has\_input", "has\_output", "is\_format\_of", "is\_identifier\_of"
   - Many edits (to concepts and "is\_a" relations) to improve navigability in all sub-ontologies

New "Identifier" sub-ontology
   - Containing concepts which were under Data<-Identifier
   - For fine-grained annotation of identifiers of data

"Resource" sub-ontology obsoleted
   - Most concepts merged into "Topic" sub-ontology (see below)
   - All remaining concepts in "resource" namespace obsoleted

Major revisions to "Topic" sub-ontology
   - Concepts redefined as "...general bioinformatics subject or category, such as a field of study, data, processing, analysis or technology."
   - For coarse-grained annotation of diverse resources
   - Subsumes concepts from old "resource" sub-ontology (see above)

EDAM-specific relations
   - Many new relations added (most term statements which should define relations now do)
   - Relations defined on parent only (not duplicated in children)

"Format" sub-ontology
   - About 50 new formats added





# EDAM\_beta11.obo
- Entire "Entity" branch (all terms) made obsolete

- Root term of "resource" namespace ("Data resource") renamed to "Resource"
