remark: EDAM (EMBRACE Data And Methods) is an ontology of bioinformatics operations (tool, application, or workflow functions), types of data, topics (application domains), and data formats. The applications of EDAM are within organising tools and data, finding suitable tools in catalogues, and integrating them into complex applications or workflows. Semantic annotations with EDAM are applicable to diverse entities such as for example Web services, databases, programmatic libraries, standalone tools and toolkits, interactive applications, data schemas, data sets, or publications within bioinformatics. Annotation with EDAM may also contribute to data provenance, and EDAM terms and synonyms can be used in text mining. EDAM - and in particular the EDAM Data sub-ontology - serves also as a markup vocabulary for bioinformatics data on the Semantic Web.
remark: EDAM editors: Jon Ison and Matus Kalas. Co-authors: Inge Jonassen, Hamish McWilliam, James Malone, Rodrigo Lopez, Helen Parkinson, Steve Pettifer, and Peter Rice. Funding: No funding targetted exclusively the development of EDAM; contibutions from these projects: EMBRACE (FP6, EU), EMBOSS (BBSRC, UK), eSysbio and FUGE Bioinformatics Platform (both Research Council of Norway). See http://edamontology.org for documentation and licence.

The enriched areas contain the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins.  For example, a transcription factor binding site.

comment: An isochore is long region (> 3 KB) of DNA with very uniform GC content, in contrast to the rest of the genome. Isochores tend tends to have more genes, higher local melting or denaturation temperatures, and different flexibility. Methods might calculate fractional GC content or variation of GC content, predict methylation status of CpG islands etc. This includes methods that visualise CpG rich regions in a nucleotide sequence, for example plot isochores in a genome sequence.

def: "Infer haplotypes, either alleles at multiple loci that are transmitted together on the same chromosome, or a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on a single chromatid that are statistically associated." [http://edamontology.org]
comment: Haplotype inference can help in population genetic studies and the identification of complex disease genes, , and is typically based on aligned single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) fragments. Haplotype comparison is a useful way to characterize the genetic variation between individuals. An individual's haplotype describes which nucleotide base occurs at each position for a set of common SNPs. Tools might use combinatorial functions (for example parsimony) or a likelihood function or model with optimization such as minimum error correction (MEC) model, expectation-maximization algorithm (EM), genetic algorithm or Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).

comment: A phylogenetic 'shadow' represents the additive differences between individual sequences. By masking or 'shadowing' variable positions a conserved sequence is produced with few or none of the variations, which is then compared to the sequences of interest to identify significant regions of conservation.

[http://edamontology.org]
comment: This is a broad data type and is used a placeholder for other, more specific types.  The notions of 'data', 'report', 'annotation' and 'metadata' are somewhat subjective and overlapping. 'Report' is used to indicate human-readable collections of information which (typically) are computer-generated from analysis of primary (e.g. core sequence or structural) data, as distinct from the primary data itself or human-generated annotation on an entity. 'Annotation' indicates human-readable collections of information which (typically) is generated or collated by hand and which describes a biological entity, phenomena or associated primary (e.g. sequence or structural) data, as distinct from the primary data itself and computer-generated reports derived from it.  'Metadata' indicates data concerning or describing some core data, as distinct from the primary data that is being described.  This includes metadata on the origin, source, history, ownership or location of some thing.

comment: A cytogenetic map is built from a set of mutant cell lines with sub-chromosomal deletions and a reference wild-type line ('genome deletion panel'). The panel is used to map markers onto the genome by comparing mutant to wild-type banding patterns. Markers are linked (occur in the same deleted region) if they share the same banding pattern (presence or absence) as the deletion panel.

comment: Methods might use fingerprints, motifs, profiles, hidden Markov models, sequence alignment etc to provide a mapping of a query protein sequence to a secondary database (Prosite, Blocks, ProDom, Prints, Pfam etc.).

comment: A protein active site signature corresponds to an enzyme catalytic pocket. An active site typically includes non-contiguous residues, therefore multiple signatures may be required to describe an active site. ; residues involved in enzymatic reactions for which mutational data is typically available.

Use this concept for calculated substitution rates, relative site variability, data on sites with biased properties, highly conserved or very poorly conserved sites, regions, blocks etc.

comment: An expectation value (E-Value) is the expected number of observations which are at least as extreme as observations expected to occur by random chance. The E-value describes the number of hits with a given score or better that are expected to occur at random when searching a database of a particular size. It decreases exponentially with the score (S) of a hit. A low E value indicates a more significant score.

Each data type can be associated with several resources. Each resource is a physical location of a service (typically a database) providing information on the elements of a data type. Several resources may exist for each data type, provided the same (mirrors) or different information. MIRIAM provides a stable and persistent reference to its data types.

comment: Sequence masking is where specific characters or positions in a molecular sequence are masked (replaced) with an another (mask character). The mask type indicates what is masked, for example regions that are not of interest or which are information-poor including acidic protein regions, basic protein regions, proline-rich regions, low compositional complexity regions, short-periodicity internal repeats, simple repeats and low complexity regions. Masked sequences are used in database search to eliminate statistically significant but biologically uninteresting hits.

comment: This qualifier consists of a stable ID portion (3+5 format with 3 position letters and 5 numbers) plus a version number after the decimal point. When the protein sequence encoded by the CDS changes, only the version number of the /protein_id value is incremented; the stable part of the /protein_id remains unchanged and as a result will permanently be associated with a given protein; this qualifier is valid only on CDS features which translate into a valid protein.
