# How to contribute to EDAM

__Your pull requests, issues, comments and suggestions are warmly welcome!__ üôèüèΩüôáüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**Note:** If you don't want to edit an OWL file (RDF/XML) or deal with Git, please skip to the bottom of this file to find [**other very welcome ways to contribute**](#other-contributions). üéàüôåüèΩ


## Source code

The "source code" of EDAM is in the file `EDAM_dev.owl` (see [main](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/blob/main/EDAM_dev.owl)). The format of the source file is RDF/XML. `EDAM_dev.owl` can be editted locally (_e.g._ in a [text editor](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/editors/)), or online on [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/#https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology). The file is too big to be editted directly on GitHub.


### New to Git?

Some neat efficient learning resources are:
 - Quick introduction|refresh of [Git and GitHub](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/02-refresher/) (101)
 - Install Git: see [here](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/01-setup) and [here](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#git)
 - Install a convenient [text editor](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/editors/) ([see also](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#editor))
 - [Learn Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/) (great for both beginners and advanced)
 - [Forking and creating pull requests](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/03-distributed/) on GitHub


### Git setup on your local machine

__Please make sure to read the following when you are cloning this repo:__

There is a __pre-commit [hook](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/05-hooks/)__ set up, to validate that the source code of EDAM is in the right format. To make it work, please use one of the following 2 options:

üòÆ Wait a second! __Is this too fast? Do you need a slightly more step-by-step guide?__ Then you are welcome to follow issue [#616](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/issues/616).


#### Option 1

This is the preferred option. Your __git__ version needs to be __2.9.0 or higher__ for the hook to work, which is nowadays usually the case.

Please make sure to have set up the correct path to the hooks directory, locally or globally:

* Run `git config core.hooksPath` from inside of your forked and cloned _edamontology_ repo, and see if it returns the value `.githooks`.
* **If it doesn't, to set it locally for your _edamontology_ repo, run: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`** inside your _edamontology_ repo.
* Alternatively, to set it globally for your Git: `git config --global core.hooksPath .githooks`.
* Tip: to see your Git config with where all the variables are stored, run `git config --list --show-origin` from inside of your _edamontology_ repo.


#### Option 2

If you have to|want to continue using an older version of __git__ than __2.9.0__, please either run the pre-commit script manually:
- Inside the _edamontology_ repo, run: `./.githooks/pre-commit`. If the script returns zero (`0`), the source code is invalid (_i.e._ not containing any _owl:Class_ string).

or better, **copy the files from the `.githooks` folder** in your _edamontology_ repo **into the `.git/hooks` folder** in your _edamontology_ repo. (Please do this again when the hooks scripts get updated and you pull the updates from the central _edamontology_ repo!)

#### Test that it's set up correctly:

1. Make a dummy change in `EDAM_dev.owl` using a text editor, and try to commit it to a **new, experimental Git branch** (see above if you need to learn or refresh Git: commits, branches). The commit should work, and you should see the output `Yay! Your commit to EDAM Ontology was successful.`.
2. Now replace all `owl:Class` in the `EDAM_dev.owl` file with for example `wol:Class` ü¶â, and try to commit that change. The commit should fail now (returning `0`), not allowing you to commit.
3. (If you haven't done this in a new, experimental branch, reset the HEAD of your current branch (_e.g._ `main`) back to the last "proper" commit. If you have done it in an experimental branch, please make sure that you don't continue doing your next, "real" changes into this branch.üòâ)


### Using Gitpod

_TODO_


### How to add a new concept

To add a new concept to `EDAM_dev.owl`, first find the place where to put it in the code.üîç The concepts (defined as `owl:Class`) are sorted alphabetically by their URIs.
- A new _**Format**_ concept goes underneath the last _Format_, right above the first _Operation_ (search `<!-- http://edamontology.org/operation_0004 -->`).
- A new _**Topic**_ concept goes underneath the last _Topic_, right above the _ObsoleteClass_ (`<!-- http://www.geneontology.org/formats/oboInOwl#ObsoleteClass -->` on the bottom of the file).
- Similarly _**Operation**_ right above the first _Topic_ (`<!-- http://edamontology.org/topic_0003 -->`), and _**Data**_ right above the first _Format_ (`<!-- http://edamontology.org/format_1196 -->`).

Please create a new Git branch in your fork of the _edamontology_ repo, and add the one (or more) concept(s) in the right place in the `EDAM_dev.owl` file. It's usually the easiest to copy one of the following templates, and fill in the concrete information inside.üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª _N.B._: Many attributes are __optional__, please remove them completely if you're not filling them in.

Please leave 3 empty lines before and after each concept (`owl:Class`), one empty line between `<!-- http://edamontology.org/ID -->` and `owl:Class`, and no empty lines inside the `owl:Class` concept definition.üôáüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Please create a pull request after you push your changes; __draft__ pull requests (work in progress) are also very welcome!üëçüèΩ The maintainers will appreciate if you create separate Git branches and thus separate pull requests for solving separate issues | separate needs.üôèüèΩ However, if adding a set of **inter-related** concepts, it's the best to do that in one branch and one pull request.

You can either keep **_XXXX_** as the numeric ID, or use the number stored in `next_id` in the header of `EDAM_dev.owl`, and update the `next_id` with +1.üßôüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è When adding multiple concepts in one branch, you can use **XXX1, XXX2, ...** or `next_id` accordingly. You can also update the `oboOther:date` to the date & time of saving your file (in UTC).‚è≤ These edits are, however, **optional** (although highly appreciated!üöÄüôåüèΩ), and can be updated by maintainers when merging the pull request.üë©üèΩ‚Äçüè≠
